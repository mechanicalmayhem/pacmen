## Description:
In this exercise we demontrate control of the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript. By clicking the 'Add PacMan' button, a new PacMan will be added to the screen. Clicking the 'Start Game' button will start them all moving on random trajectories as well as bouncing them off the browser walls.
## How to Run:
Open index.html in your browser.
## Roadmap of Future Improvements:
In the future I would like to add functionality that will change the PacMan icon to the appropriate direction depending on which way the PacMan is traveling (i.e. facing left if he is traveling left).
